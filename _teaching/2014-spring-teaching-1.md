# Advanced Fluorescence, a course by Prof. J. Hofkens

Course on the in-depth application of fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging. The course covers a broad range of imaging techniques from basics to advanced: Confocal vs widefield imaging STORM, PALM, TIRF, FLIM, STED, ... . Additionally students are introduced to optics, calculating fluorescence quantum yields and determining FRET efficiencies. As a master topic this course keeps a focus on research applied cases.
