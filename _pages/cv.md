* Born in Knokke-Heist, 15th December 1994
* Currently living in Zulte (9870)
* Ph.D in Biochemistry, KU Leuven, 2018-2023 (expected June 2023))


Education
======
* B.S. in Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Katholic University Leuven devidion Kortrijk (KULAK), 2012-2016
* M.S. in Biochemistry, KU Leuven, 2016-2018 (Master thesis: Studying multimerization of Integrase during HIV infection using a FLIM-based FRET phasor analysis)
* Ph.D in Biochemistry, KU Leuven, 2018-2023 (expected June 2023))

Work experience
======
* Summer 2018: Research Assistant (R&D)
  * Nelson Labs NV (A Sotera Health Company)
  * Duties included: Development of automated gas chromatography protocols
  * Supervisor: Frank De Smedt  (Director of Lab Operations)

* Summer 2018: Research Assistant
  * KU Leuven
  * Duties included: Optimizing a homebuilt confocal time resolved microscope
  * Supervisor: Prof. J. Hofkens

Skills
======
* Teamwork
  * A PhD learned me to optimize experimental work and interlaboratory collaborations with fellow researchers. I found a transparent environment with clear communication key and will always work with the team in mind.
* Problem Solving and microscopy protocol validation
  * Having 5 years of experience building and adapting custom built confocal time-resolved microscopes I learned valuable and transferable skills on developing clear protocols and validating performance of such systems.
* Microscopy
  * Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) applications
  * Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) using Phasor Analysis
  * Troubleshooting and alignment of custom microscopes (experience with Thorlabs setup equipment)
* Sample preparation involving fixations, FCS samples to check setup alignment (confocal volume), cell culture and transfections.

Workshops
======
* NanoMacro Microscopy Workshop 5-7 sept 2018, Hasselt (attended & gave workshop)
