<br/><br/>

* Born in Knokke-Heist, 15th December 1994
* Currently living in Zulte (9870)
* Curious and versatile researcher with a mind for technology and the future


Education
======
* B.S. in Biochemistry and Biotechnology, KU Leuven division Kortrijk (KULAK), 2012-2016
* M.S. in Biochemistry, KU Leuven, 2016-2018 (Master thesis: "Studying multimerization of Integrase during HIV infection using a FLIM-based FRET phasor analysis")
      Supervisor: Prof. Dr. J. Hendrix
      Co-supervisor: Prof. Dr. J. Hofkens
* Ph.D in Biochemistry, KU Leuven, 2018-2023 (Title: "The application of phasor analysis for FLIM-FRET biosensors", expected June 2023)
      Supervisor: Prof. Dr. J. Hofkens
      Co-supervisor: Prof. Dr. S. Rocha

Work experience
======

* February to June 2018: Intern (R&D)
  * Nelson Labs NV (A Sotera Health Company)
  * Duties included: Development of automated gas chromatography protocols
  * Supervisor: Prof. F. De Smedt  (Director of Lab Operations)
* Summer 2018: Research Assistant (R&D)
  * Nelson Labs NV (A Sotera Health Company)
  * Duties included: Investigating leachables of medical devices using gas chromatography
  * Supervisor: Prof. F. De Smedt  (Director of Lab Operations)

* Fall 2018: Research Assistant
  * KU Leuven
  * Duties included: Optimizing a homebuilt confocal time resolved microscope
  * Supervisor: Prof. J. Hofkens

Skills
======
* Teamwork
  * During my PhD I learned to optimize experimental work and interlaboratory collaborations with fellow researchers. I found a transparent environment with clear communication key and will always work with the team in mind.
* Problem solving and microscopy protocol validation
  * Having 5 years of experience building and adapting custom built confocal time-resolved microscopes I learned valuable and transferable skills on developing clear protocols and validating performance of such systems
* Microscopy
  * Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) applications
  * Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) using Phasor Analysis
  * Troubleshooting and alignment of custom microscopes (experience with Thorlabs setup equipment)
* Sample preparation involving fixations, FCS samples to check setup alignment (confocal volume), cell culture and transfections

Workshops
======
* NanoMacro Microscopy Workshop 5-7 sept 2018, Hasselt (attended & gave workshop)
* Organizer and presenter of the ‘Feel the Force summer school’ 2021. This was a 3 day intensive course to force measuring with (FRET) biosensors and TFM. I was organizer, gave a plenary lecture on phasor-FLIM and in addition provided small group hands-on classes at the microscope. This was supported by the Arenberg Doctoral School (ADS) of KU Leuven

Conference presentations
======
* Pacifichem 2021 conference (online-only conference due to COVID-19 regulations)
https://pacifichem.org/
“Phasor for FLIM-FRET analysis of intracellular vinculin tension sensors”
* Plenary session on FRET analysis for biosensors at the 2021 ‘Feel the Force summer school’ at KU Leuven
(https://www.kuleuven.be/english/summer-schools/feeltheforce/home )
“Analysis of FRET Data using Intensity and FLIM methods”
* Open presentation for the chemistry department
"Phasor analysis for FLIM-FRET biosensor data:a case study of HIV-Integrase oligomerization and vinculin tension sensors"

Conference poster presentations
======
* Dutch Biophysics 2018 Veldhoven, Netherlands
* Satellite Workshop of the DGfB biannual meeting "Advanced Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Imaging" 2018 Düsseldorf, Germany
* 25th PicoQuant ‘Single Molecule, Spectroscopy and Super-resolution Microscopy in the Life Sciences’ meeting 3-6 sept 2019 Berlin, Germany
* Let there Be …Light – Frans De Schryver Symposium – October 2019 Leuven
* EACR tumor microenvironment 2020 - March 2020, Lisbon, Portugal

Software packages
======
* Illustrator
* Adobe Acrobat
* Microsoft Office applications
* Matlab (plotting, scripts and (image) data analysis)
* Python (self-though basics)
* ImageJ
* OneNote (reports of meetings, logbook, data sharing hub, project pages)
* Teams/Zoom/Skype
* Audacity, Leica LasX, PicoQuant Sypmhotime64, GitHub

Languages
======
* French (basic)
* English (very good)
* Dutch (first language)

Teaching
======
* Advanced Fluorescence, a course by Prof. J. Hofkens (KU Leuven)

Course on the in-depth application of fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging. The course covers a broad range of imaging techniques from basics to advanced: Confocal imaging,  widefield imaging, STORM, PALM, TIRF, FLIM, STED, ... . Additionally students are introduced to optics, calculating fluorescence quantum yields and determining FRET efficiencies. Since this is a course in the master for biochemistry students it keeps a focus on research applied cases.
